# randon-number-generate

A simple random number generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project is designed as a front-end practice exercise, allowing you to generate a random number within a user-defined range.

## 📄 Overview

randon-number-generate lets the user set a minimum and maximum value, then click a button to generate a random number within that range. The result is displayed immediately on the page. The tool is lightweight, user-friendly, and runs entirely in the browser—no external dependencies required.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – structure of the UI and user inputs.  
- **CSS3** – styling and layout.  
- **JavaScript** – logic for random number generation, event handling, and interface update.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SWtheaven/randon-number-generate.git

2. Navigate into the project folder:

cd randon-number-generate

3. Open index.html in your browser — everything runs client-side, no extra setup needed.

Enter the minimum and maximum values, click the generate button, and see the random number appear instantly.

✨ Future Improvements / Possible Features

    - Input validation: ensure minimum and maximum are valid numbers and minimum ≤ maximum.

    - User feedback for invalid inputs (e.g., display error message if the interval is invalid).

    - More polished and responsive UI — modern design, animations, light/dark mode, etc.

    - Option to keep history of generated numbers.

    - Ability to generate multiple random numbers at once.
